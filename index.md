<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>



I am currently a postdoctoral researcher advised by [Prof. Ju Ren](https://juren1987.github.io/) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). 

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **deep learning system**. My research interests include **on-device and edge intelligence**, **optimizations for resource-constrained devices**, and **computer vision**.

Previously, I received my B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D. degrees all in computer science, from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), China, in 2016, 2018 and 2023, co-advised by [Prof. Yaoxue Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4004.htm") and [Prof. Deyu Zhang](https://deyujonney.github.io/deyu/). I was a visiting scholar at [HCS Lab](https://hcs.snu.ac.kr/), [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) in 2022-2023, working with [Prof. Youngki Lee](http://youngkilee.blogspot.com/). I also joined HEX group at Microsoft Research Asia([MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/)) from Sept. 2019 to Mar. 2020, and Institute for AI Industry Research([AIR](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/)), Tsinghua University from Aug. 2021 to Apr. 2022 as a research intern, respectively, mentored by [Prof. Yunxin Liu](https://yunxinliu.github.io/).
