<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [Tsinghua University](https://www.illinois.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and my B.S. in Electronic Information Engineering at [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I also spent time at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), and [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My biography is [here](./biography.html).
